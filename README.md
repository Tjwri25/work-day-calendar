# Work Day Calendar 

URL: https://tjwri25.github.io/work-day-calendar/

I created a simple work day scheduling application, where you can add your events into each time block, and save them even after the page has been refreshed. The current date and time is displayed at the top. Each time block is color coded to whether the hour is past (gray), present (red), or future (green). 

Using this scheduler you can: 
* Choose your time of day, between 9am and 5pm 
* Click on the time block and add a comment or event for that time period
* Click the save button 

The event will then be saved in local storage in that time block, and will stay displayed on the page after leaving the page, or after being refreshed. 

You can also delete the event, save it, and the time block will then be empty.
